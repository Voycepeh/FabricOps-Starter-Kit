> **Multiple Write blocks:** each `orchestrate_write()` publishes independently. If an earlier Write succeeds and a later Write fails, the pipeline is partially published. A retry runs the earlier Write again, which can duplicate or otherwise repeat non-idempotent writes such as Append. If partial publication or duplicate writes are unacceptable, use separate pipeline executions for each governed target.

For the end-to-end workflow, follow the [Guided Demo](https://voycepeh.github.io/FabricOps-Starter-Kit/guided-demo/).
